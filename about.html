This is my second semester. I completed my undergraduate degree in International Business with an Information Systems concentration at Ramapo College. I was working after attending college and then decided that furthering my education was something I was really interested in. I have some basic knowledge of Java, Visual Basic, Rapidminer, Adobe suite, Microsoft Office, Visio, SQL developer, and now HTML, CSS, GitHub, amongst other things. I am a passionate individual who enjoys helping others. My hobbies include technology, the internet, hiking, camping, yoga, running, and art of all forms. </p><h2>ABOUT THE GUIDE: </h2><p>This guide was inspired by my current Web Systems course at NJIT and started in July 2014.
