		<h2>What exactly is CSS?</h2>
		<p>
		According to the w3schools.com definition, put simply CSS (or Cascading Style Sheets) is the language (or code) that works with markup languages (in our case HTML) to provide format and style of a document. While HTML can provide colors and fonts to each individual piece of text, if you have multiple paragraphs it would take up a lot of time.
		<br>One style sheet can be shared across multiple web pages. For instance, check out the different pages of Amelia's Guide. Notice the background color and various fonts stay the same? This is all under one stylesheet maintaining the format and style. <br>
		Say you just move into a house and bought a bunch of stuff to put inside it (like furniture, appliances, etc.) but they were scattered about with no organization. You or an interior designer may decide to everything inside and organize and style in an aesthetically pleasing and simple to navigate way. Think of the stuff as content or HTML and the design you did to make the house look nicer and more organized as the CSS. <br><br>
		Need a minute to refresh your memory? Go back to the <u><a href="content_one.html">HTML</a></u> page here.
		 </p>
		<h2>How can I make my own style sheet?</h2>
		<p>As said before at the HTML page, you can use a fancy editor or plain text notepad 
		to write your CSS. Do not save it as a text file (.txt) but as a .css file. 
		<br>Another important thing to note is that the HTML file that you are trying to style 
		must be linked to your CSS file. <br><br>
		Below shows what must be put into the HTML file if your CSS file is called stylesheet.css
		and saved in the same file location.<br><br>

<!--As you can see, the body contains a link to the CSS document with the format below-->

		<h2>Let's get started with basic CSS Syntax!</h2>
		<p> CSS includes a selector (which links an HTML tag to the CSS document, for instance an h1 tag will now be an h1 selector) and multiple properties and their value.
		<br><br>The below image illustrates this.<br>
		<img src="http://www.w3schools.com/css/selector.gif" alt="css selector">
		<br><br>It's time to try it out yourself.<br>
		<textarea cols='60' rows='30'>
/*A comment in CSS is different than one HTML. Let's first change the style of the heading. You use brackets to start & end a selector.*/

*
{
	background-color: gray;
}

/*The star selector represents the entire CSS document. This will automatically make the entire doc have these given properties until overwritten.*/

h1
{ 	
	color: blue;
	font-size: 24px;
	font-family: Georgia, Serif;
}

/*Multiple font families can be written down. If one font doesn't work in a browser, it will try the next. To find out more about specific fonts, visit http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_websafe_fonts.asp */

p
{
	color: #FF0000;
	font-size: 12px;
	font-family: Arial, Tahoma;
}

/*The color hex number above is red. There are millions of colors. You can find more here: http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_colors.asp */ 

/*Each document can automatically be divided as have a content space area, padding which outlines it, a border which outlines padding, and a margin which outlines the border.*/

div
{
	background-color: white;
	padding: 10px;
	border: 5px;
	margin-top: 10px;
	margin-left: 5px;
	border-style: solid;
	border-color: black;	
}

/*All sides can be the same size as seen in padding. However, each side can be different sizes as seen with the margin. (top, left, right, bottom) Read more about the box model here: http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_boxmodel.asp and go back to the star selector if you want to change the entire document's outline.*/
		</textarea>
<br><br>Use the above to play around! Then copy it into your own notepad at home to test it out.
		</p>
		<p>This the result of the given code. You will get the same result if copying and pasting it to your own file. Try making your own result!</p>

		<h2>How do I position my divs?</h2>
		<p>There are different ways to position things in CSS. There is Normal Flow, Floats, and Absolute positioning, Static Positioning, Relative positioning, and Fixed positioning. <br>
<b>Normal flow </b> "includes block formatting of block boxes, inline formatting of inline boxes, relative positioning of block or inline boxes, and positioning of run-in boxes."<br>
<b>Floats</b> start as "a box is first laid out according to the normal flow, then taken out of the flow and shifted to the left or right as far as possible. Content may flow along the side of a float."<br>
<b>Absolute positioning</b> is when "a box is removed from the normal flow entirely (it has no impact on later siblings) and assigned a position with respect to a containing block." 
<a href="http://www.vanseodesign.com/css/understanding-css-floats/">[1]</a><br>
<b>Fixed positioning</b> "is a subcategory of absolute positioning. The only difference is that for a fixed positioned box, the containing block is established by the browser window size. A fixed element does not move when a web page is scrolled as all other elements do."<br>
<b>Static Positioning</b> "is applied by the declaration "position: static". This places the element in the normal flow. Since normal flow is the default it is not normally necessary to explicitly use this. Where it is useful is over-riding another rule of lower specifity." <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets/Positioning#Position_Schemes">[2]</a>
<br>
<b>Relative positioning</b> is when "the element remains in the normal layout flow but the the element's position can be specified by top, right, bottom and left properties relative to the element's normal flow position in the document."
<a href="http://xhtml.com/en/css/reference/position/">[3]</a>
